Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that offers a choice of high-performing foundation models (FMs) from leading AI companies like AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Cohere, DeepSeek, Luma, Meta, Mistral AI, poolside (coming soon), Stability AI, TwelveLabs (coming soon), Writer, and Amazon through a single API, along with a broad set of capabilities you need to build generative AI applications with security, privacy, and responsible AI. Using Amazon Bedrock, you can easily experiment with and evaluate top FMs for your use case, privately customize them with your data using techniques such as fine-tuning and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and build agents that execute tasks using your enterprise systems and data sources. Since Amazon Bedrock is serverless, you don't have to manage any infrastructure, and you can securely integrate and deploy generative AI capabilities into your applications using the AWS services you are already familiar with.


Use Amazon Bedrock Marketplace to discover, test, and use over 100 popular, emerging, and specialized foundation models (FMs).

Use Amazon Bedrock IDE, part of the new Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio, to discover Amazon Bedrock models and build generative AI apps that use Amazon Bedrock models and features.
Amazon Bedrock is designed for use cases where you want to build generative AI applications without investing heavily in custom model development. For example, a content moderation system for a social media platform could use Amazon Bedrock's pre-trained models to automatically identify and flag inappropriate text or images. Similarly, a customer support chatbot could use Amazon Bedrock's natural language processing capabilities to understand and respond to user inquiries. Amazon Bedrock is particularly useful if you have limited machine learning expertise or resources, as it helps you to benefit from AI without the need for extensive in-house development.
Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that offers a choice of industry leading foundation models (FMs) along with a broad set of capabilities that you need to build generative AI applications, simplifying development with security, privacy, and responsible AI. With the comprehensive capabilities of Amazon Bedrock, you can experiment with a variety of top FMs, customize them privately with your data using techniques such as fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and create managed agents that execute complex business tasks—from booking travel and processing insurance claims to creating ad campaigns and managing inventory—all without writing any code. Since Amazon Bedrock is serverless, you don't have to manage any infrastructure, and you can securely integrate and deploy generative AI capabilities into your applications using the AWS services you are already familiar with.

There are five reasons to use Amazon Bedrock for building generative AI applications.

Choice of leading FMs: Amazon Bedrock offers an easy-to-use developer experience to work with a broad range of high-performing FMs from Amazon and leading AI companies like AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, Mistral AI, and Stability AI. You can quickly experiment with a variety of FMs in the playground, and use a single API for inference regardless of the models you choose, giving you the flexibility to use FMs from different providers and keep up to date with the latest model versions with minimal code changes.

Easy model customization with your data: Privately customize FMs with your own data through a visual interface without writing any code. Simply select the training and validation data sets stored in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and, if required, adjust the hyperparameters to achieve the best possible model performance.

Fully managed agents that can invoke APIs dynamically to execute tasks: Build agents that execute complex business tasks—from booking travel and processing insurance claims to creating ad campaigns, preparing tax filings, and managing your inventory—by dynamically calling your company systems and APIs. Fully managed agents for Amazon Bedrock extend the reasoning capabilities of FMs to break down tasks, create an orchestration plan, and execute it.

Native support for RAG to extend the power of FMs with proprietary data: With Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases, you can securely connect FMs to your data sources for retrieval augmentation—from within the managed service—extending the FM’s already powerful capabilities and making it more knowledgeable about your specific domain and organization.

Data security and compliance certifications: Amazon Bedrock offers several capabilities to support security and privacy requirements. Amazon Bedrock is in scope for common compliance standards such as Service and Organization Control (SOC), International Organization for Standardization (ISO), is Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) eligible, and customers can use Amazon Bedrock in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Amazon Bedrock is CSA Security Trust Assurance and Risk (STAR) Level 2 certified, which validates the use of best practices and the security posture of AWS cloud offerings. With Amazon Bedrock, your content is not used to improve the base models and is not shared with any model providers. Your data in Amazon Bedrock is always encrypted in transit and at rest, and you can optionally encrypt the data using your own keys. You can use AWS PrivateLink with Amazon Bedrock to establish private connectivity between your FMs and your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) without exposing your traffic to the Internet.
